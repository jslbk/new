# Description:
There are three tests in 'rectangle.test.js' file that checks functions from the 'cectangle.js'.
One test for every function.

## Test 1:
First test checks function that returns rectangles perimeter after adding lenght and width values

- To check algorithm enter length and width (length, width);
- Set the expected result value (perimeter);
- Expected result should match actual to pass;

## Test 2:
Second test checks function that returns rectangles area after adding lenght and width values.

- To check algorithm enter length and width (length, width);
- Set the expected result value (area);
- Expected result should match actual to pass;

## Test 3:
Second test checks function that returns rectangles area after adding lenght and width values.

- To check algorithm enter length and width for perimeter const (lenght, width);
- To check algorithm enter length and width for area const (lenght, width);
- Set the expected result that should be printed in console log ('The perimeter of a rectangle is 8 and the area is 4');
- Expected result should match actual to pass;

### Note:
Set the 'export' before every 'function' in 'rectangle.js' file to make tests work.
